Homework 11
Continue developing your Volcano NFT project
1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of
Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself).
Done.

2. Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where
we can store metadata / images for the NFT.
Done

3. What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token
URI ?
Is there is poor security, some one could modify the URI with malicious intent.

4. Review the notes about the EVM in Lesson 5 in preparation for tomorrow's lesson
about gas optimisation.
