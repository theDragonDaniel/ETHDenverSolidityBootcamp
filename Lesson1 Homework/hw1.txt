Since I am not in a team yet to discuss this, I will be thinking out loud on here.

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like,
if there was no software on a central server.

Personal thoughts: Monopoly already has no software on a central server. Unless they mean the electronic version of the game.

Consider
What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
The player would need to connect to each other directly. The change and community chest cards would have to be completely random.
The dice rolls have to be random and untampered. The amount of initial money, payments to/from the bank/players has to be known.

How would people cheat ?
Skip turns, interfere with the dice rolls, community chest and chance cards. Not charge/collect money on purpose.

How could you prevent them from cheating ?
Have a way to keep track of turns. Have a dice roller and card shuffler. have a log showing a history of the game so far and a way to automatically charge/pay players.



This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed
design.
